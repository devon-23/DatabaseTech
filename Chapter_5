Safe update mode in MySQL Workbench
	 By default, MySQL Workbench runs in safe update mode.
	 Safe update mode prevents you from updating rows if the 
		WHERE clause is omitted or doesn’t refer to a primary key or 
		foreign key column.
	 You can turn safe update mode off by selecting th Edit
	Preferences command, selecting the SQL Editor node, 
		changing the “Safe Updates” option, and restarting MySQL 
		Workbench.

The syntax of the DELETE statement
	DELETE FROM table_name
	[WHERE search_condition]

Delete one row
	DELETE FROM general_ledger_accounts
	WHERE account_number = 306
	(1 row affected)

Delete one row using a compound condition
	DELETE FROM invoice_line_items
	WHERE invoice_id = 78 AND invoice_sequence = 2
	(1 row affected)

Delete multiple rows

Use a subquery in a DELETE statement
