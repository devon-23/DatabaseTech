ON --> join condition

DISTINCT --> makes only one result of that

Use join to join the tables --->
	it must be something they have in common. 
	if they don't have something in common, 
	you need to join other tables to it till
	they finally connect/join.

Ch 4 ---------------->
NATURAL JOIN --
	you dont need to specify a join condition,,,
	it does it automatically
	can't do natural join if columns don't have
	the same name (?)
	ex
		SELECT *
		FROM vendors
		NATURAL JOIN invoices
